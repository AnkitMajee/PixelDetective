# End-to-End Machine Learning/Data Science Project

This repository contains a guide and code samples for building an end-to-end machine learning or data science project, focusing on face and eyes detection using OpenCV, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, tuning, and deploying a Flask server for serving HTTP requests from a UI.

## Prerequisites

- Python (3.6+)
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- Flask
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Data files used in the project
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models
- `src/`: Source code for data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and Flask server
- `ui/`: UI code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Steps

1. **Face and Eyes Detection Using OpenCV**: Use OpenCV library to detect faces and eyes in images or video streams.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Utilize the detected faces for data cleaning and apply feature engineering techniques such as wavelet transforms.

3. **Model Building**: Build machine learning models for classification tasks using SVM, logistic regression, and random forest algorithms.

4. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the models using GridSearchCV to improve performance.

5. **Export Model**: Export the trained model to a file for later use.

6. **Flask Server**: Write a Flask server that can serve HTTP requests generated by the UI.

7. **Build UI**: Create a user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to interact with the Flask server.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
